# README

To begin running the backend environment, clone down this repo and run a `bundle install` command.  You'll then want to run your migrations with `rails db:migrate`.

You can create some seed data if you choose but the app should be ready to go without it.  Just run `rails s` to begin hosting the application.

This app is designed to be using in conjunction with Progress Tracker Frontend which can be found here(https://github.com/tjaRoxasXIII/progress-tracker-frontend)
